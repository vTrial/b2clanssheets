How to operate b2 clans sheets

### Step 1: Download Packages
Copy and paste the following command into your terminal to download and install the required packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file. This will also ensure that the packages are updated to their latest versions.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Step 2: Create `credentials.json`
Create a file named `credentials.json` and insert the following content. Replace `INSERT CLIENT SECRET` with the actual client secret obtained from the Google Developer Console.

```json
{
    "installed": {
        "client_id": "207373962191-gm8mke4us1u78q5gqm1sb01g63ete5ni.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "project_id": "battles-2-clans",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_secret": "INSERT CLIENT SECRET",
        "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"]
    }
}
```

Note: Make sure to replace `INSERT CLIENT SECRET` with your actual client secret.
